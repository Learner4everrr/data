Addition of exogenous miRNA-128 to CRL-1690 and CRL-2610 GBM cell lines (a) restored 'homeostatic' ARP5 (ANGPTL6), Bmi-1 and E2F-3a expression, and (b) significantly decreased the proliferation of CRL-1690 and CRL-2610 cell lines.  Three bioinformatics-verified miRNA-128 targets, angiopoietin-related growth factor protein 5 (ARP5; ANGPTL6), a transcription suppressor that promotes stem cell renewal and inhibits the expression of known tumor suppressor genes involved in senescence and differentiation, Bmi-1, and a transcription factor critical for the control of cell-cycle progression, E2F-3a, were found to be up-regulated.  The down-regulation of miRNA-128 was found to inversely correlate with WHO tumor grade.  High density micro-RNA (miRNA) arrays, fluorescent-reporter miRNA assay and Northern miRNA dot-blot analysis show that a brain-enriched miRNA-128 is significantly down-regulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and in GBM cell lines when compared to age-matched controls.  Micro-RNA-128 (miRNA-128) down-regulation in glioblastoma targets ARP5 (ANGPTL6), Bmi-1 and E2F-3a, key regulators of brain cell proliferation.  ",

This step permitted rapid induction of oncogenic transcription factors, such as c-FOS, encoded by immediate early genes.  EGF decreases the abundance of microRNAs that restrain oncogenic transcription factors.   The earliest event involved a decrease in the abundance of a subset of 23 microRNAs.

MicroRNAs miR-143 and miR-145 modulate cytoskeletal dynamics and responsiveness of smooth muscle cells to injury.   Serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivator, myocardin, play a central role in the control of smooth muscle phenotypes by regulating the expression of cytoskeletal genes.  We show that SRF and myocardin regulate a cardiovascular-specific microRNA (miRNA) cluster encoding miR-143 and miR-145.  To assess the functions of these miRNAs in vivo, we systematically deleted them singly and in combination in mice.  Mice lacking both miR-143 and miR-145 are viable and do not display overt abnormalities in smooth muscle differentiation, although they show a significant reduction in blood pressure due to reduced vascular tone.  Remarkably, however, neointima formation in response to vascular injury is profoundly impeded in mice lacking these miRNAs, due to disarray of actin stress fibers and diminished migratory activity of SMCs.  These abnormalities reflect the regulation of a cadre of modulators of SRF activity and actin dynamics by miR-143 and miR-145.  Thus, miR-143 and miR-145 act as integral components of the regulatory network whereby SRF controls cytoskeletal remodeling and phenotypic switching of SMCs during vascular disease.   ",

Downregulation of Pdcd4 by mir-21 facilitates glioblastoma proliferation in vivo.   In this study, we examined the role of oncogenic mir-21 in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor.  They function by regulating target gene expression post-transcriptionally.  We demonstrate that downregulation of mir-21 in glioblastoma-derived cell lines results in increased expression of its target, programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4), a known tumor-suppressor gene.  We have previously reported that mir-21 is expressed at higher levels in primary glioblastoma-tissue and glioblastoma-derived cell lines than in normal brain tissue.  Using a glioblastoma xenograft model in immune-deficient nude mice, we observe that glioblastoma-derived cell lines in which mir-21 levels are downregulated or Pdcd4 is over-expressed exhibit decreased tumor formation and growth.  In addition, our data indicate that either downregulation of mir-21 or overexpression of its target, Pdcd4, in glioblastoma-derived cell lines leads to decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and decreased colony formation in soft agar.  Significantly, tumors grow when the glioblastoma-derived cell lines are transfected with anti-mir-21 and siRNA to Pdcd4, confirming that the tumor growth is specifically regulated by Pdcd4.  These critical in vivo findings demonstrate an important functional linkage between mir-21 and Pdcd4 and further elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the known high level of mir-21 expression in glioblastoma can attribute to tumorigenesis--namely, inhibition of Pdcd4 and its tumor-suppressive functions.

CONCLUSION: : Acute-phase differential expression of plasma miRNAs predicts CNS disease and suggests that CNS damage or predisposition to disease progression begins in the earliest phase of infection.  At least six miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in individuals with severe versus no CNS disease; in an unweighted expression test, they predicted CNS disease.  miRNAs tracked with viral load and platelet count were also predictors of CNS disease.  OBJECTIVE: : Plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) are modulated during disease and are emerging biomarkers; they have not been characterized in HIV infection.  A plasma microRNA signature of acute lentiviral infection:  biomarkers of central nervous system disease.   miRNA expression was compared with levels of cytokines, virus, and plasma platelet count.  METHODS: : Plasma miRNA expression profiles were determined by TaqMan low-density array for six individuals.  DESIGN: : Plasma samples were obtained before inoculation and 10 days after inoculation from SIV-infected macaques.  Using our macaque/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model of HIV, we sought to identify a plasma miRNA profile of acute lentiviral infection, evaluate its relationship with known cellular and viral determinants of lentivirus-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease, and explore the potential of miRNAs to predict CNS disease.  Several differentially expressed miRNAs correlated with CNS disease-associated cytokines interleukin-6 and CCL2 and included predicted and/or validated regulators of the corresponding mRNAs.  RESULTS: : A 45-miRNA signature of acute infection (differential expression with P\u200a<\u200a0.05 after multiple comparison correction) classified plasma as infected or not.  Nineteen individuals were used to validate a disease prediction test.  miRNA results were confirmed by single miRNA-specific assays for 10 macaques. ",

Moreover, the correlations of miR-182 level with the clinical features of glioma suggested in the in situ hybridization analysis were further verified by the real-time RT-PCR analysis.  The cumulative 5-year survival rate of glioma patients was 51.54% (95% confidence interval, 0.435 to 0.596) in the low miR-182-expression group, whereas it was only 7.23% (95% confidence interval, 0.027 to 0.118) in the high miR-182-expression group (P = 0.001), and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-182 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for the survival of glioma patients.  Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between miR-182 expression and World Health Organization glioma grading (P < 0.001).  Elevated expression of miR-182 was further identified by in situ hybridization in 248 of 253 (98%) archived human glioma biopsies tested.  Quantitative PCR analysis showed that miR-182 was significantly increased by up to 32-fold in glioma tumors compared with the adjacent nontumor brain tissues obtained from the same patient.  We report that the expression level of miR-182 was markedly up-regulated in glioma cell lines and in human primary glioma specimens.  Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNA expression can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for human cancers. ",

        "text": "Recently, we have found that microRNA (miRNA) miR-145 is the most abundant miRNA in normal vascular walls and in freshly isolated VSMCs; however, the role of miR-145 in VSMC phenotypic modulation and vascular diseases is currently unknown.  Phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases.  More importantly, both in cultured rat VSMCs in vitro and in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries in vivo, we demonstrate that the noncoding RNA miR-145 is a novel phenotypic marker and a novel phenotypic modulator of VSMCs.  Here we find that miR-145 is selectively expressed in VSMCs of the vascular wall and its expression is significantly downregulated in the vascular walls with neointimal lesion formation and in cultured dedifferentiated VSMCs.  MicroRNA-145, a novel smooth muscle cell phenotypic marker and modulator, controls vascular neointimal lesion formation.   These novel findings may have extensive implications for the diagnosis and therapy of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases.    We have further identified that miR-145-mediated phenotypic modulation of VSMCs is through its target gene KLF5 and its downstream signaling molecule, myocardin.  VSMC differentiation marker genes such as SM alpha-actin, calponin, and SM-MHC are upregulated by premiR-145 or adenovirus expressing miR-145 (Ad-miR-145) but are downregulated by the miR-145 inhibitor 2'OMe-miR-145.  We conclude that miR-145 is a novel VSMC phenotypic marker and modulator that is able of controlling vascular neointimal lesion formation.  Finally, restoration of miR-145 in balloon-injured arteries via Ad-miR-145 inhibits neointimal growth. ",

A recurring challenge for brain pathologists is to diagnose whether a brain malignancy is a primary tumor or a metastasis from some other tissue.  MiR-92b and miR-9/9* are specifically expressed in brain primary tumors and can be used to differentiate primary from metastatic brain tumors.   These microRNAs thus represent excellent biomarkers for brain primary tumors.  By considering the expression of only these two microRNAs, it is possible to distinguish between primary and metastatic brain tumors with very high accuracy.  Using microRNA expression profiling, we found that hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/hsa-miR-9* are over-expressed, specifically in brain primary tumors, as compared to primary tumors from other tissues and their metastases to the brain.  MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA species that regulate gene expression; many exhibit tissue-specific expression and are misregulated in cancer.  Previous reports have found that hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/hsa-miR-9* are expressed more strongly in developing neurons and brain than in adult brain.  Thus, their specific over-expression in brain primary tumors supports a functional role for these microRNAs or a link between neuronal stem cells and brain tumorigenesis.   ",

Glioblastoma (GBM) represents a formidable clinical challenge for both patients and treating physicians.  Due to better local treatments and prolonged patient survival, remote recurrences are increasingly observed, underpinning the importance of targeting tumour migration and attachment.  Aberrant expression of microRNA (miRNA) is commonly associated with cancer and loss of miR-124a has previously been implicated to function as a tumour suppressor.  The assessment of miR-124a in clinical specimens has been limited and a potential role in migration and invasion has been unexplored until now.  We measured the expression levels of mature miR-124a in a retrospective series of 119 cases of histologically confirmed GBM and found its expression was markedly lower in over 80% of the GBM clinical specimens compared to normal brain tissue.  The level of reduction in the clinical cohort varied significantly and patients with lower than the average miR-124a expression levels displayed shorter survival times.  Endogenous miR-124a expression and the protein expression of three of its targets; IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), laminin \u03b31 (LAMC1) and integrin \u03b21 (ITGB1) were significantly reciprocally associated in the majority of the clinical cases.  We confirmed this association in our in vitro model.  miR-124a is frequently down-regulated in glioblastoma and is involved in migration and invasion.   Functionally, the ectopic expression of mature miR-124a in a GBM cell line resulted in significant inhibition of migration and invasion, demonstrating a role for miR-124a in promoting tumour invasiveness.

Foremost among these is miR-9, which suppresses mesenchymal differentiation in glioblastoma by downregulating expression of JAK kinases and inhibiting activation of STAT3.  Taken together, our results define developmental microRNA expression signatures that both characterize and contribute to the phenotypic diversity of glioblastoma subclasses, thereby providing an expanded framework for understanding the pathogenesis of glioblastoma in a human neurodevelopmental context.    These microRNA-based glioblastoma subclasses displayed microRNA and mRNA expression signatures resembling those of radial glia, oligoneuronal precursors, neuronal precursors, neuroepithelial/neural crest precursors, or astrocyte precursors.  In this study, we analyzed 261 microRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), identifying five clinically and genetically distinct subclasses of glioblastoma that each related to a different neural precursor cell type.  We also identified several microRNAs as potent regulators of subclass-specific gene expression networks in glioblastoma.  Each subclass was determined to be genetically distinct, based on the significant differences they displayed in terms of patient race, age, treatment response, and survival.  mRNA expression profiling has suggested the existence of multiple glioblastoma subclasses, but their number and characteristics vary among studies and the etiology underlying their development is unclear.

The study of miRNAs is rapidly growing and recent studies have revealed a significant role of miRNAs in vascular biology and disease.  Many miRNAs are highly expressed in the vasculature, and their expression is dysregulated in diseased vessels.  Several miRNAs have been found to be critical modulators of vascular pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, lipoprotein metabolism, inflammation, arterial remodeling, angiogenesis, smooth muscle cell regeneration, hypertension, apoptosis, neointimal hyperplasia and signal transduction pathways.  Thus, miRNAs may serve as novel biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for vascular disease.

This resulted in significantly improved in vivo selectivity over the use of a control vector without miRNA regulation, enabling effective elimination of human glioma xenografts while producing negligible toxic effects on normal astrocytes.  In the context of cancer suicide gene therapy, this approach may lead to cytotoxic effects in both cancer and nontarget normal cells.  Considering microRNA (miRNA) function in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, we have developed a viral vector platform combining cellular promoter-based transcriptional targeting with miRNA regulation for a glioma suicide gene therapy in the mouse brain.  Thus, incorporating miRNA regulation into a transcriptional targeting vector adds an extra layer of security to prevent off-target transgene expression and should be useful for the development of gene delivery vectors with high targeting specificity for cancer therapy.

        "text": "Interestingly, the above data suggested that in both the PTEN mutant and the wild-type GBM cells, miR-21 blockage increased the chemosensitivity to taxol.  It is worth noting that the miR-21 inhibitor additively interacted with taxol on U251cells and synergistically on LN229 cells.  Furthermore, the miR-21 inhibitor significantly enhanced apoptosis in both U251 cells and LN229 cells, and cell invasiveness was obviously weakened.  The data strongly suggested that a regulatory loop between miR-21 and STAT3 might provide an insight into the mechanism of modulating EGFR/STAT3 signaling.  CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the miR-21 inhibitor could enhance the chemo-sensitivity of human glioblastoma cells to taxol.  Thus, the miR-21 inhibitor might interrupt the activity of EGFR pathways, independently of PTEN status.  Meanwhile, the expression of STAT3 and p-STAT3 decreased to relatively low levels after miR-21 inhibitor and taxol treatment.  A combination of miR-21 inhibitor and taxol could be an effective therapeutic strategy for controlling the growth of GBM by inhibiting STAT3 expression and phosphorylation.    Expression of miR-21 was investigated by RT-PCR, and western blotting was performed to evaluate malignancy related protein alteration.  RESULTS: IC(50) values were dramatically decreased in cells treated with miR-21 inhibitor combine with taxol, to a greater extent than those treated with taxol alone.  The mechanism between the miR-21 inhibitor and the anticancer drug taxol was analyzed using the Zheng-Jun Jin method.  Annexin V/PI staining was performed, and apoptosis and the cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry analysis.  BACKGROUND: Substantial data indicate that the oncogene microRNA 21 (miR-21) is significantly elevated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and regulates multiple genes associated with cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasiveness.  MicroRNA-21 inhibitor sensitizes human glioblastoma cells U251 (PTEN-mutant) and LN229 (PTEN-wild type) to taxol.   The 50% inhibitory concentration and cell viability were determined by the MTT assay.  METHODS: Human glioblastoma U251 (PTEN-mutant) and LN229 (PTEN wild-type) cells were treated with taxol and the miR-21 inhibitor (in a poly (amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer), alone or in combination.  So far, the effect of downregulating miR-21 to enhance the chemotherapeutic effect to taxol has not been studied in human GBM.  Thus, miR-21 can theoretically become a target to enhance the chemotherapeutic effect in cancer therapy. ",

To examine the direct effect of manipulating endogenous miR-29b on hPGRN expression, we established a stable NIH3T3 cell line that expresses hPGRN under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter.  Endogenous hPGRN in HEK 293 cells was also regulated by miR-29b.  Conversely, knockdown of endogenous miR-29b with locked nucleic acid increased the production and secretion of hPGRN in NIH3T3 cells.  How progranulin (PGRN) expression is regulated is largely unknown.  Progranulin deficiency is thought to cause some forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a major early-onset age-dependent neurodegenerative disease.  miR-29b downregulates the expression of luciferase through hPGRN or mouse PGRN (mPGRN) 3'UTRs, and the regulation was abolished by mutations in the miR-29b binding site.  We identified an evolutionarily conserved binding site for microRNA-29b (miR-29b) in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the human PGRN (hPGRN) mRNA.  MicroRNA-29b regulates the expression level of human progranulin, a secreted glycoprotein implicated in frontotemporal dementia.   These findings identify miR-29b as a novel posttranscriptional regulator of PGRN expression, raising the possibility that miR-29b or other miRNAs might be targeted therapeutically to increase hPGRN levels in some FTD patients.

MicroRNAs are small RNAs that attenuate protein expression by complementary binding to the 3'-UTR of a target mRNA.  MicroRNA-21 protects neurons from ischemic death.   In particular, microRNA-21 (miR-21) is a strong antiapoptotic factor in some biological systems.  Currently, very little is known about microRNAs after cerebral ischemia.  We employed in situ hybridization and laser capture microdissection in combination with real-time RT-PCR to investigate the expression of miR-21 after stroke.  We investigated the role of miR-21 after stroke in the rat.  In vitro, overexpression of miR-21 in cultured cortical neurons substantially suppressed oxygen and glucose deprivation-induced apoptotic cell death, whereas attenuation of endogenous miR-21 by antisense inhibition exacerbated cell death after oxygen and glucose deprivation.  In situ hybridization revealed that miR-21 expression was upregulated in neurons of the ischemic boundary zone, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that stroke increased mature miR-21 levels by approximately threefold in neurons isolated from the ischemic boundary zone by laser capture microdissection as compared with homologous contralateral neurons 2 days (n = 4; P < 0.05) and 7 days (n = 3; P < 0.05) after stroke.  Our data indicate that overexpression of miR-21 protects against ischemic neuronal death, and that downregulation of FASLG, a tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 family member and an important cell death-inducing ligand whose gene is targeted by miR-21, probably mediates the neuroprotective effect.  Moreover, overexpression of miR-21 in neurons significantly reduced FASLG levels, and introduction of an miR-21 mimic into 293-HEK cells substantially reduced luciferase activity in a reporter system containing the 3'-UTR of Faslg.

Three microRNA upregulated in active multiple sclerosis lesions (microRNA-34a, microRNA-155 and microRNA-326) targeted the 3'-untranslated region of CD47 in reporter assays, with microRNA-155 even at two distinct sites.  This converged on CD47, which functions as a 'don't eat me' signal inhibiting macrophage activity.  We established microRNA profiles from active and inactive multiple sclerosis lesions.  Using laser capture microdissection from multiple sclerosis lesions to pool single cells and in vitro cultures, we assigned differentially expressed microRNA to specific cell types.  MicroRNA profiling of multiple sclerosis lesions identifies modulators of the regulatory protein CD47.   This was confirmed with astrocyte cultures from microRNA-155-|-lacZ mice.  We matched microRNA upregulated in phagocytically active multiple sclerosis lesions with downregulated protein coding transcripts.  Astrocytes contained all 10 microRNA that were most strongly upregulated in active multiple sclerosis lesions, including microRNA-155, which is known to modulate immune responses in different ways but so far had not been assigned to central nervous system resident cells.

The miRNA miR-23a was predicted to bind XIAP mRNA.  miR-23a directly bound the 3' UTR of XIAP, and miR-23a inhibition led to an increase in XIAP mRNA in vitro, demonstrating that XIAP is a previously uncharacterized target for miR-23a.  Embelin treatment significantly exacerbated stroke-induced injury in females but had no effect in males, demonstrating that XIAP is an important mediator of sex-specific responses after stroke.    miR-23a levels differed in male and female ischemic brains, providing evidence for sex-specific miRNA expression in stroke.  Embelin, a small-molecule inhibitor of XIAP, decreased the interaction between XIAP and caspase-3 and led to enhanced caspase activity.  It is increasingly recognized that the mechanisms underlying ischemic cell death are sexually dimorphic.  miR-23a regulation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) contributes to sex differences in the response to cerebral ischemia.   In contrast, ischemic cell death in females is primarily triggered by mitochondrial cytochrome c release with subsequent caspase activation.  Stroke-induced cell death in males is initiated by the mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor, resulting in caspase-independent cell death.  XIAP mRNA levels were higher in females at baseline.  Because X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is the primary endogenous inhibitor of caspases, its regulation may play a unique role in the response to injury in females.  However, XIAP protein levels were decreased in both sexes after stroke.  Stroke induced a significant decrease in XIAP mRNA in females, whereas no changes were seen in the male brain. ",

Recent preclinical studies have shown that the cellular tropism of several viruses can be controlled by inserting microRNA-target sequences into their genomes, thereby inhibiting spread in tissues expressing cognate microRNAs.  Oncolytic measles viruses (MV) derived from the live attenuated vaccine strain have been engineered for increased tumor-cell specificity, and are currently under investigation in clinical trials including a phase I study for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  MicroRNA-sensitive oncolytic measles viruses for cancer-specific vector tropism.   This is proof-of-concept that tropism restriction by tissue-specific microRNAs can be adapted to oncolytic MV to regulate viral replication and gene expression to maximize tumor specificity without compromising oncolytic efficacy.    Furthermore, microRNA-mediated inhibition protected genetically modified mice susceptible to MV infection from a potentially lethal intracerebral challenge.  Importantly, endogenous microRNA-7 expression in primary human brain resections tightly restricted replication and spread of microRNA-sensitive virus.  In presence of microRNA-7 this modification inhibits translation of envelope proteins, restricts viral spread, and progeny production.  Even though highly attenuated in presence of microRNA-7, this virus retained full efficacy against glioblastoma xenografts. ",

The TT genotype resulted in a significant reduction in overall stroke risk {OR, 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36-0.74], P = 0.0003}, ischemic stroke [OR, 0.56 (95% CI, 0.36-0.85), P = 0.007] and hemorrhagic stroke [OR, 0.46 (95% CI, 0.26-0.80), P = 0.007].  We found that the A allele of rs2507800 suppressed angiopoietin-1 translation by facilitating miR-211 binding, but not the T allele.  Subjects carrying the TT genotype had higher plasma angiopoietin-1 levels than those with the A allele.  To test our hypothesis, a predicted microRNA-binding site was found in the 3'-UTR of angiopoietin-1 using bioinformatics; variant rs2507800 was identified to be located in the miR-211-binding site of angiopoietin-1.  Secondly, the effects of the identified variant on angiopoietin-1 translation were assessed using a luciferase reporter assay and ELISA.  Angiopoietin-1 is a vascular strengthening factor during vascular development and a protective factor for pathological vascular inflammation and leakage.  Brain vascular leaking and inflammation are two important pathological processes of stroke; therefore, we hypothesized that variants of the microRNA-binding site in angiopoietin-1 would affect its expression and confer a risk of stroke.  A functional variant in the 3'-UTR of angiopoietin-1 might reduce stroke risk by interfering with the binding efficiency of microRNA 211.   Our results provide evidence that the TT genotype (rs2507800) in the 3'-UTR of angiopoietin-1 might reduce the risk of stroke by interfering with miR-211 binding.

We also tested a mouse model where miR-107 has been shown to be down-regulated.  However, GRN regulation expression is poorly understood.  A high-throughput experimental microRNA assay showed that GRN is the strongest target for miR-107 in human H4 neuroglioma cells.  miR-107 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and sequence elements in the open reading frame-rather than the 3' untranslated region-of GRN mRNA are recognized by miR-107 and are highly conserved among vertebrate species.  To better understand the mechanism of this interaction, FLAG-tagged Argonaute constructs were used following miR-107 transfection.  miR-107 regulates granulin/progranulin with implications for traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disease.   Granulin (GRN, or progranulin) is a protein involved in wound repair, inflammation, and neoplasia.  GRN has also been directly implicated in frontotemporal dementia and may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.  GRN mRNA interacts preferentially with Argonaute 2. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that regulation of GRN by miR-107 may be functionally important.  Glucose supplementation in cultured cells that leads to increased miR-107 levels also results in decreased GRN expression, including changes in cell compartmentation and decreased secretion of GRN protein.

MiR-21 protected human glioblastoma U87MG cells from chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide induced apoptosis by decreasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity.   Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some up-regulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells.  In mammal animals, their function mainly represses the target mRNAs transcripts via imperfectly complementary to the 3'UTR of target mRNAs.  However, resistance develops quickly and with high frequency.  Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent, is a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioblastoma.  Our studies showed that TMZ markedly enhanced apoptosis in U87MG cells compared with untreated cells (P<0.05).  To explore the mechanism of resistance, we found that miR-21 could protect human glioblastoma U87MG cells from TMZ induced apoptosis.  However, over-express miR-21 in U87MG cells could significantly reduce TMZ-induced apoptosis (P<0.05).  Pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are known to regulate the apoptosis of glioma cells.  Further research demonstrated that the mechanism was associated with a shift in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and change in caspase-3 activity.  Bax is shown to correlate with an increased survival of glioblastoma multiforme patients.  However, such effect was partly prevented by treatment of cells with miR-21 overexpression before, which appeared to downregulate the Bax expression, upregulate the Bcl-2 expression and decrease caspase-3 activity.  Compared to control cells, cells treated with TMZ showed a significant increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity (P<0.01).  Taken together, these results suggested that over-express miR-21 could inhibit TMZ-induced apoptosis in U87MG cells, at least in part, by decreasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, which highlighted the possibility of miR-21 overexpression in the clinical resistance to chemotherapeutic therapy of TMZ.    Bcl-2, resistance to induction of apoptosis, constitutes one major obstacle to chemotherapy in many cancer cells. ",

We then found that by targeting the LKB1 kinase complex miR-451 suppresses the activity of downstream protein kinases including the major energy biosensor AMPK.  We initially identified miR-451 due to its downregulation in a glioma cell migration assay.  Under conditions of glucose withdrawal, miR-451 downregulation is necessary for AMPK pathway activation, leading to suppressed proliferation rates, increased cell survival and migration.  MiR-451 levels are regulated by glucose; under conditions of abundant energy miR-451 expression is high, and the suppression of AMPK signaling allows cells to maintain elevated proliferation rates via unrestrained mTOR activation.  Incomplete knowledge of the molecular biology, genetics, causes and cellular origin of these tumors may limit the development of improved therapeutics.  Glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, is rapidly growing and highly infiltrative.  Here we will discuss further our recently published data on the role of miR-451 in the biology of glioblastoma.  A major and fundamental advance in recent years has been the identification of microRNAs as highly conserved regulators of gene expression.  microRNA-451: A conditional switch controlling glioma cell proliferation and migration.

Here, we show that a key regulator of this signaling is miR-206, a skeletal muscle-specific microRNA that is dramatically induced in a mouse model of ALS.  Mice that are genetically deficient in miR-206 form normal neuromuscular synapses during development, but deficiency of miR-206 in the ALS mouse model accelerates disease progression.  miR-206 is required for efficient regeneration of neuromuscular synapses after acute nerve injury, which probably accounts for its salutary effects in ALS.  miR-206 mediates these effects at least in part through histone deacetylase 4 and fibroblast growth factor signaling pathways.  MicroRNA-206 delays ALS progression and promotes regeneration of neuromuscular synapses in mice.   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons, denervation of target muscles, muscle atrophy, and paralysis.  Understanding ALS pathogenesis may require a fuller understanding of the bidirectional signaling between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers at neuromuscular synapses. ",

We hypothesized that suppression of miR-21 might sensitize gliomas for cytotoxic tumor therapy.  With the use of locked nucleic acid (LNA)-antimiR-21 oligonucleotides, bimodal imaging vectors, and neural precursor cells (NPC) expressing a secretable variant of the cytotoxic agent tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (S-TRAIL), we show that the combined suppression of miR-21 and NPC-S-TRAIL leads to a synergistic increase in caspase activity and significantly decreased cell viability in human glioma cells in vitro.  This phenomenon persists in vivo, as we observed complete eradication of LNA-antimiR-21-treated gliomas subjected to the presence of NPC-S-TRAIL in the murine brain.  Our results reveal the efficacy of miR-21 antagonism in murine glioma models and implicate miR-21 as a target for therapeutic intervention.  Furthermore, our findings provide the basis for developing combination therapies using miRNA modulation and cytotoxic tumor therapies.    MicroRNA-21 knockdown disrupts glioma growth in vivo and displays synergistic cytotoxicity with neural precursor cell delivered S-TRAIL in human gliomas.   Mounting evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNA) might play a fundamental role in tumorigenesis, controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Compared to picornaviruses and adenoviruses, the engineered VSVs were relatively resistant to microRNA-mediated inhibition, but neurotoxicity could nevertheless be ameliorated significantly using this approach, without compromise to antitumor efficacy.

Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas expression data set reveals a strong positive correlation between numerous genes sustaining cellular growth and miR-10b levels in human glioblastomas, while proapoptotic genes anticorrelate with the expression of miR-10b.  Molecular functions of these miRNAs in gliomagenesis are mainly unknown.  We show that inhibition of miR-10b, a miRNA not expressed in human brain and strongly upregulated in both low-grade and high-grade gliomas, reduces glioma cell growth by cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.  Human glioma growth is controlled by microRNA-10b.   MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiling studies revealed a number of miRNAs dysregulated in the malignant brain tumor glioblastoma.  Altogether, our experiments validate an important role of miR-10b in gliomagenesis, reveal a novel mechanism of miR-10b-mediated regulation, and suggest the possibility of its future use as a therapeutic target in gliomas.    Furthermore, survival of glioblastoma patients expressing high levels of miR-10 family members is significantly reduced in comparison to patients with low miR-10 levels, indicating that miR-10 may contribute to glioma growth in vivo.

Therefore, miR15 and miR16 down-regulation in pituitary adenomas correlates with a greater tumor diameter and a lower p43 secretion, suggesting that these genes may, at least in part, influence tumor growth.

Gliomas express many genes that play a role in neural precursor cells (NPCs), but no direct comparison between glioma and stem cell (SC) gene expression profiles has been performed.  To investigate the similarities and differences between gliomas and SCs, we compared the microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures of glial tumors, embryonic SCs (ESCs), NPCs, and normal adult brains from both human and mouse tissues.  We demonstrated that both human gliomas (regardless of their grade) and methylcholanthrene-induced mouse glioma shared an miRNA expression profile that is reminiscent of NPCs.  About half of the miRNAs expressed in the shared profile clustered in seven genomic regions susceptible to genetic/epigenetic alterations in various cancers.  These clusters comprised the miR17 family, mir183-182, and the SC-specific clusters mir367-302 and mir371-373, which are upregulated in gliomas, ESCs, and NPCs.  The bipartite cluster of 7 + 46 miRNAs on chromosome 14q32.31,  which might represent the largest tumor suppressor miRNA cluster, was downregulated in the shared expression profile.  This study provides the first evidence for association between these clusters and gliomas.  Despite the broad similarity in the miRNA expression profiles, 15 miRNAs showed disparate expression between SC and gliomas.  Ten miRNAs belong to the 2 SC-specific clusters and the remaining (mir135b, mir141, mir205, mir200C, and mir301a) have been previously shown to associate with malignancies.  Our finding showed that all gliomas displayed NPC-like miRNA signatures, which may have implications for studies of glioma origins.  Furthermore, careful study of the 15 miRNAs that differ in expression between SCs and gliomas, particularly those 5 that are not SC-specific, may enhance our understanding of gliomagenesis.   ",

        "text": "A series of novel and established medulloblastoma defects were detected (MYC amplification (n = 4), 17q21.31 high-level gain (n = 1); 9p21.1-p21.3 (n = 1) and 6q23.1 (n = 1) homozygous deletion).  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a SNP-array based genome-wide copy number analysis in medulloblastoma cell lines, to identify regions of genomic amplification and homozygous deletion, which may harbour critical disease genes.  Most notably, a novel recurrent region of genomic amplification at 8q24.22-q24.23 was identified (n = 2), and selected for further investigation.  Amplification and overexpression of Hsa-miR-30b, Hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 at 8q24.22-q24.23 in medulloblastoma.   The identification of critical genes involved in its pathogenesis will be central to advances in our understanding of its molecular basis, and the development of improved therapeutic approaches.  BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour of childhood.  Of these, only expression of hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 correlated with copy number status, and all three of these transcripts also displayed evidence of elevated expression in sub-sets of primary medulloblastomas, measured relative to the normal cerebellum.  Additional analysis by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (iFISH), PCR-based mapping and SNP-array revealed this novel amplification at 8q24.22-q24.23 is independent of MYC amplification at 8q24.21, and is unique to medulloblastoma in over 800 cancer cell lines assessed from different tumour types, suggesting it contains key genes specifically involved in medulloblastoma development.  Detailed mapping identified a 3Mb common minimal region of amplification harbouring 3 coding genes (ZFAT1, LOC286094, KHDRBS3) and two genes encoding micro-RNAs (hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d).  Our findings suggest critical roles for these genes in medulloblastoma development, and further support the contribution of micro-RNA species to medulloblastoma pathogenesis.    CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data implicate hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 as putative oncogenic target(s) of a novel recurrent medulloblastoma amplicon at 8q24.22-q24.23. ",

        "text": "Recently, it was demonstrated that podoplanin membrane sialo-glycoprotein encoded by PDPN gene is over-expressed and related to cellular invasion in astrocytic tumors; however the mechanisms of regulation are still unknown.  Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant brain tumor, characterized by an elevated capacity for cellular proliferation and invasion.  miR-29b and miR-125a regulate podoplanin and suppress invasion in glioblastoma.   Taken together, these results suggest that miR-29b and miR-125a represent potential therapeutic targets in glioblastoma.    In this study, we focused on miR-29b and miR-125a, which were predicted to regulate PDPN, and demonstrated that these microRNAs directly target the 3' untranslated region of PDPN and inhibit invasion, apoptosis, and proliferation of glioblastomas.  Furthermore, we report that miR-29b and miR-125a are downregulated in glioblastomas and also in CD133-positive cells.  MicroRNAs are noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression and several biological processes and diseases, including cancer.  Nevertheless, their roles in invasion, proliferation, and apoptosis of glioblastoma are not completely understood. ",

Our data show a critical role for microRNA in T(H)-17 differentiation and the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.    Interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing T helper cells (T(H)-17 cells) are increasingly recognized as key participants in various autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis.  Although sets of transcription factors and cytokines are known to regulate T(H)-17 differentiation, the role of noncoding RNA is poorly understood.  Here we identify a T(H)-17 cell-associated microRNA, miR-326, whose expression was highly correlated with disease severity in patients with multiple sclerosis and mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).  In vivo silencing of miR-326 resulted in fewer T(H)-17 cells and mild EAE, and its overexpression led to more T(H)-17 cells and severe EAE.  MicroRNA miR-326 regulates TH-17 differentiation and is associated with the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.  ",

        "text": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder caused by environmental and genetic factors.  Variation in the miRNA-433 binding site of FGF20 confers risk for Parkinson disease by overexpression of alpha-synuclein.   Subsequently, fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20) at 8p21.3-22 was identified as a risk factor in several association studies.  We have previously shown linkage of PD to chromosome 8p.  In a sample of 729 nuclear families with 1089 affected and 1165 unaffected individuals, the strongest evidence of association came from rs12720208 in the 3' untranslated region of FGF20.  To identify the risk-conferring polymorphism in FGF20, we performed genetic and functional analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene.  In a cell-based system and in PD brains, this increase in translation of FGF20 is correlated with increased alpha-synuclein expression, which has previously been shown to cause PD through both overexpression and point mutations.  We show in several functional assays that the risk allele for rs12720208 disrupts a binding site for microRNA-433, increasing translation of FGF20 in vitro and in vivo.  We propose this is likely to be a common mechanism of genetic modulation of individual susceptibility to complex disease.    We suggest a novel mechanism of action for PD risk in which the modulation of the susceptibility gene's translation by common variations interfere with the regulation mechanisms of microRNA. ",
