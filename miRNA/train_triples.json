They form two groups according to their expression profile in control, non-treated, early-onset and treated Parkinson's disease subjects.  A set of six differentially expressed microRNAs were identified.

        "text": "This reveals a previously unrecognized signaling cascade involved in meningioma tumor development and highlights a novel molecular interaction between miR-200a and Wnt signaling, thereby providing insights into novel therapies for meningiomas.    A direct correlation was found between the downregulation of miR-200a and the upregulation of beta-catenin in human meningioma samples.  Thus, miR-200a appears to act as a multifunctional tumor suppressor miRNA in meningiomas through effects on the E-cadherin and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways.  miR-200a was found to directly target beta-catenin mRNA, thereby inhibiting its translation and blocking Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which is frequently involved in cancer.  Downregulation of miR-200a in meningiomas and arachnoidal cells resulted in increased expression of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 involved in cell proliferation.  Upregulation of miR-200a decreased the expression of transcription factors ZEB1 and SIP1, with consequent increased expression of E-cadherin, an adhesion protein associated with cell differentiation.  Elevated levels of miR-200a inhibited meningioma cell growth in culture and in a tumor model in vivo.  Meningiomas, one of the most common human brain tumors, are derived from arachnoidal cells associated with brain meninges, are usually benign, and are frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. Here, we define a typical human meningioma microRNA (miRNA) profile and characterize the effects of one downregulated miRNA, miR-200a, on tumor growth.  Downregulated microRNA-200a in meningiomas promotes tumor growth by reducing E-cadherin and activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.  ",

Patterns of microRNA expression in normal and early Alzheimer's disease human temporal cortex: white matter versus gray matter.   MicroRNA (miRNA) expression was assessed in human cerebral cortical gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in order to provide the first insights into the difference between GM and WM miRNA repertoires across a range of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.  RNA was isolated separately from GM and WM portions of superior and middle temporal cerebral cortex (N = 10 elderly females, postmortem interval < 4 h).  miRNA profiling experiments were performed using state-of-the-art Exiqon(\u00a9) LNA-microarrays.  A subset of miRNAs that appeared to be strongly expressed according to the microarrays did not appear to be conventional miRNAs according to Northern blot analyses.  Some well-characterized miRNAs were substantially enriched in WM as expected.  However, most of the miRNA expression variability that correlated with the presence of early AD-related pathology was seen in GM.  We confirm that downregulation of a set of miRNAs in GM (including several miR-15/107 genes and miR-29 paralogs) correlated strongly with the density of diffuse amyloid plaques detected in adjacent tissue.  A few miRNAs were differentially expressed in WM, including miR-212 that is downregulated in AD and miR-424 which is upregulated in AD.

Our data suggest PKM2 inhibition as a therapy for glioblastoma, with the potential for minimal toxicity to the brain.    Strikingly, cells with high levels of PKM2 expressed lower levels of miR-326, suggestive of endogenous regulation of PKM2 by miR-326.  Emerging studies have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) as possible therapeutic tools for the treatment of glioma, the most aggressive brain tumor.  Pyruvate kinase M2 is a target of the tumor-suppressive microRNA-326 and regulates the survival of glioma cells.   Their important targets in this tumor are not well understood.  We recently found that the Notch pathway is a target of miRNA-326.  Ectopic expression of miRNA-326 in glioma and glioma stem cells induced their apoptosis and reduced their metabolic activity.  Computational target gene prediction revealed pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) as another target of miRNA-326.  PKM2 has recently been shown to play a key role in cancer cell metabolism.  To investigate whether it might be a functionally important target of miR-326, we used RNA interference to knockdown PKM2 expression in glioma cells.  Transfection of the established glioma and glioma stem cells with PKM2 siRNA reduced their growth, cellular invasion, metabolic activity, ATP and glutathione levels, and activated AMP-activated protein kinase.  The cytotoxic effects exhibited by PKM2 knockdown in glioma and glioma stem cells were not observed in transformed human astrocytes. ",

Transcriptional dysregulation of coding and non-coding genes in cellular models of Huntington's disease.   HD (Huntington's disease) is a late onset heritable neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by neuronal dysfunction and death, particularly in the cerebral cortex and medium spiny neurons of the striatum.  This is followed by progressive chorea, dementia and emotional dysfunction, eventually resulting in death.  HD is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the first exon of the HD gene that results in an abnormally elongated polyQ (polyglutamine) tract in its protein product, Htt (Huntingtin).  Wild-type Htt is largely cytoplasmic; however, in HD, proteolytic N-terminal fragments of Htt form insoluble deposits in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, provoking the idea that mutHtt (mutant Htt) causes transcriptional dysfunction.  While a number of specific transcription factors and co-factors have been proposed as mediators of mutHtt toxicity, the causal relationship between these Htt/transcription factor interactions and HD pathology remains unknown.  Previous work has highlighted REST [RE1 (repressor element 1)-silencing transcription factor] as one such transcription factor.  Recent evidence has also shown that REST regulates transcription of regulatory miRNAs (microRNAs), many of which are known to regulate neuronal gene expression and are dysregulated in HD. Thus repression of miRNAs constitutes a second, indirect mechanism by which REST can alter the neuronal transcriptome in HD.  Many of its direct target genes are known or suspected to have a role in HD pathogenesis, including BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor).  REST is a master regulator of neuronal genes, repressing their expression. ",

In the present study, the miRNA expression profile was examined in astrocytoma, a malignant and prevalent intracranial tumour in adults.  METHODS: We screened the expression profile of 200 miRNAs in a training sample set consisting of 84 astrocytoma samples and 20 normal adjacent tissue (NAT) samples using the method of stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR.  The significantly altered miRNAs were validated in another independent sample set consisting of 40 astrocytoma samples and 40 NAT samples.  The correlation of the miRNA levels with survival in astrocytoma samples was estimated by performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.  RESULTS: After a two-phase selection and validation process, seven miRNAs were found to have a significantly different expression profile in astrocytoma samples upon comparison to the NAT samples.  Unsupervised clustering analysis further revealed the great potential of the 7-miRNA profile to differentiate between tumours and normal brain tissues.  The down-regulation of hsa-miR-137 in astrocytomas was shown to be associated with advanced clinical stages of this disease.  The use of hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-181b and hsa-miR-106a as prognostic indicators of astrocytoma.   Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis we showed that low expression of hsa-miR-181b or hsa-miR-106a, or high expression of hsa-miR-21 was significantly associated with poor patient survival.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a great potential for the use of miRNA profiling as a powerful diagnostic and prognostic marker in defining the signature of astrocytomas and in predicting the post-surgical outcome.    Moreover, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that this prognostic impact was independent of other clinicopathological factors. ",

Ectopic miR-17/92 expression in CGNPs synergized with exogenous Shh to increase proliferation and also enabled them to proliferate in the absence of Shh.  In CGNPs, the Shh effector N-myc, but not Gli1, induced miR-17/92 expression.  Consistent with its regulation by Shh, we observed that Shh treatment of primary cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP), proposed cells of origin for the Shh-associated medulloblastomas, resulted in increased miR-17/92 expression.  Medulloblastomas in which miR-17/92 was up-regulated also had elevated levels of MYC/MYCN expression.  Expression of miR-17/92 was highest in the subgroup of medulloblastomas associated with activation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway compared with other subgroups of medulloblastoma.  Profiling the expression of 427 mature microRNAs (miRNA) in a series of 90 primary human medulloblastomas revealed that components of the miR-17/92 polycistron are the most highly up-regulated miRNAs in medulloblastoma.  We identified recurrent amplification of the miR-17/92 polycistron proto-oncogene in 6% of pediatric medulloblastomas by high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays and subsequent interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization on a human medulloblastoma tissue microarray.  Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, and mechanisms underlying its development are poorly understood.

        "text": "MicroRNA regulation of IFN-beta protein expression: rapid and sensitive modulation of the innate immune response.   In primary primate macrophages, the main cell type implicated in HIV and SIV infection in the CNS, specific miRNAs reduce, whereas miRNA inhibitors enhance, IFN-beta protein production.  The potential biologic significance of this regulation is supported by evidence of an apparent negative feedback loop, with increased expression of three IFN-beta-regulating miRNAs by primate macrophages exposed to recombinant IFN-beta or stimulated to produce IFN-beta.  Thus, miRNAs may contribute significantly to the regulation of IFN-beta in innate immune responses.    IFN-beta production is an inaugural event in the innate immune response to viral infections, with relatively small fold changes in IFN-beta expression resulting in the activation of important antiviral signaling cascades.  In our rapid SIV/macaque model of HIV encephalitis, the virus enters the CNS within 4 d of infection, accompanied by a marked IFN-beta response that wanes as SIV replication is controlled.  The centrality of IFN-beta to the innate antiviral response in the CNS combines with the potential inflammatory damage associated with long-term activation of this pathway to suggest that IFN-beta may be subject to regulatory fine-tuning in addition to well-established transcriptional and message stability mechanisms of regulation.  In this paper, we present for the first time evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-26a, -34a, -145, and let-7b, may directly regulate IFN-beta in human and macaque cells. ",

Similar results were obtained by depletion of endogenous polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in cells, a recognized miR-124 target gene.  In vivo regulation of amyloid precursor protein neuronal splicing by microRNAs.   The \u03b2-amyloid peptide that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain derive from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).  Here, we present evidence that, besides APP expression regulation, miRNAs are equally involved in the regulation of neuronal APP mRNA alternative splicing.  Lack of miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is associated with APP exons 7 and 8 inclusion, while ectopic expression of miR-124, an abundant neuronal-specific miRNA, reversed these effects in cultured neurons.  Recent evidence suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in the post-transcriptional regulation of APP expression.  Because gene dosage effects of the APP gene can cause genetic AD, dysregulation of the miRNA network could contribute significantly to disease.  Since abnormal neuronal splicing of APP affects \u03b2-amyloid peptide production, these results could contribute to the understanding of the implication of miRNAs in brain health and disease.   ",

The present study provides an initial survey of miRNA expression in pediatric central nervous system (CNS) malignancies including atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma.  PROCEDURE: MicroRNA expression in pediatric brain tumors and normal tissue controls was examined by microarray.  BACKGROUND: A better understanding of pediatric brain tumor biology is needed to assist in the development of less toxic therapies and to provide better markers for disease stratification.  MicroRNAs (miRNA) may play a significant role in brain tumor biology.  When further examined by qRT-PCR, these miRNAs demonstrated differential expression that significantly correlated with the microarray findings.  Distinctive miRNA expression profiles were also observed in the different pediatric brain tumor types.  Three aberrantly expressed miRNAs were further studied in a larger cohort by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).  RESULTS: MicroRNA-129, miR-142-5p, and miR-25 were differentially expressed in every pediatric brain tumor type compared to normal tissue controls as measured by microarray.

Since its identification 3 years ago as the miRNA most commonly and strongly up-regulated in human brain tumour glioblastoma [1], miR-21 has attracted the attention of researchers in various fields, such as development, oncology, stem cell biology and aging, becoming one of the most studied miRNAs, along with let-7, miR-17-92 cluster ('oncomir-1'), miR-155 and a few others.  Particular miRNAs emerge as principal regulators that control major cell functions in various physiological and pathophysiological settings.  miR-21: a small multi-faceted RNA.

Twelve of 31 medulloblastomas were found to overexpress genes belonging to the canonical WNT signaling pathway and carry a mutation in CTNNB1 gene.  In order to get a better understanding of medulloblastoma biology, miRNA profiling of medulloblastomas was carried out in parallel with expression profiling of protein-coding genes.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: miRNA profiling of medulloblastomas was carried out using Taqman Low Density Array v 1.0 having 365 human microRNAs.  In parallel, genome-wide expression profiling of protein-coding genes was carried out using Affymetrix gene 1.0 ST arrays.  RESULTS: Both the profiling studies identified four molecular subtypes of medulloblastomas.  Distinctive microRNA signature of medulloblastomas associated with the WNT signaling pathway.   AIM: Medulloblastoma is a malignant brain tumor that occurs predominantly in children.  Current risk stratification based on clinical parameters is inadequate for accurate prognostication.  MicroRNA expression is known to be deregulated in various cancers and has been found to be useful in predicting tumor behavior.  A number of miRNAs like miR-193a, miR-224/miR-452 cluster, miR-182/miR-183/miR-96 cluster, and miR-148a having potential tumor/metastasis suppressive activity were found to be overexpressed in the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas.  CONCLUSION: Expression level of tumor/metastasis suppressive miRNAs in the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas is likely to determine their response to treatment, and thus, these miRNAs would be important biomarkers for risk stratification within the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas.    Exogenous expression of miR-193a and miR-224, two miRNAs that have the highest WNT pathway specific upregulation, was found to inhibit proliferation, increase radiation sensitivity and reduce anchorage-independent growth of medulloblastoma cells.

The results suggest that miRNAs are novel regulatory RNAs for neointimal lesion formation.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that regulate about 30% of the encoding genes of the human genome.  MicroRNA expression signature and antisense-mediated depletion reveal an essential role of MicroRNA in vascular neointimal lesion formation.   Western blot analysis demonstrated that PTEN and Bcl-2 were involved in miR-21-mediated cellular effects.  MiR-21-mediated cellular effects were further confirmed in vivo in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries.  Depletion of miR-21 resulted in decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.  In vitro, the expression level of miR-21 in dedifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells was significantly higher than that in fresh isolated differentiated cells.  Modulating an aberrantly overexpressed miRNA, miR-21, via antisense-mediated depletion (knock-down) had a significant negative effect on neointimal lesion formation.  The aberrantly expressed miRNAs were further confirmed by Northern blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.  Using microarray analysis, we demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the vascular walls after balloon injury.  However, the role of miRNAs in vascular disease is currently completely unknown. ",

Our study revealed significant upregulation of hsa-miR-342-3p and hsa-miR-494 in the brains of BSE-infected macaques compared to non-infected animals.  Shock-frozen brain sections of six BSE-infected and five non-infected macaques were used to validate regulated miRNA candidates by two independent qRT-PCR-based methods.  We have applied miRNA-microarrays to identify deregulated miRNA candidates in brains of BSE-infected macaques.  Therefore, we hypothesized that miRNAs are also regulated in response to human prion disease.  Among other functions they contribute to neuronal development and survival.  Recently, the lack of miRNA processing has been shown to promote neurodegeneration and deregulation of several miRNAs has been reported to be associated with Scrapie in mice.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs regulating gene expression by mRNA targeting.  Upregulation of miRNA hsa-miR-342-3p in experimental and idiopathic prion disease.   With respect to the reported regulation of this miRNA in Scrapie-infected mice, we propose that upregulation of hsa-miR-342-3p may be a general phenomenon in late stage prion disease and might be used as a novel marker for animal and human TSEs.

Altered expression of miRNA-21 and its targets in the hippocampus after traumatic brain injury.   In situ localization of miR-21 transcripts indicates widespread expression in normal brain, with a pronounced increase in expression after TBI evident throughout the cortex and hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus and CA3 cell layer.  We report that miR-21 expression is significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus after rodent TBI, with expression levels peaking by 3 days postinjury and returning to near sham levels by 15 days postinjury.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of noncoding regulatory RNAs providing an epigenetic mechanism for the regulation of protein expression levels of target genes.  Cellular mechanisms that can modulate these processes may play an important role in determining the nature and extent of the damage suffered after TBI and therefore influence overall outcome after injury.  These results suggest that increased miR-21 expression in the hippocampus may influence multiple components of TBI pathophysiology.    Analysis of these genes' annotated Gene Ontology molecular function and biological process terms revealed an overrepresentation of genes involved in enzyme-linked receptor signaling, transcriptional regulation, and developmental processes.

In addition, mammalian genomes contain numerous natural antisense transcripts, most of which appear to be non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).  BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to regulate diverse sets of mRNA targets.  Evidence for natural antisense transcript-mediated inhibition of microRNA function.   Indeed, miR-485-5p and BACE1-antisense compete for binding within the same region in the open reading frame of the BACE1 mRNA.  RESULTS: We report here that BACE1-antisense prevents miRNA-induced repression of BACE1 mRNA by masking the binding site for miR-485-5p.  The BACE1-antisense transcript is markedly up-regulated in brain samples from Alzheimer's disease patients and promotes the stability of the (sense) BACE1 transcript.  We have recently identified and characterized a highly conserved non-coding antisense transcript for beta-secretase-1 (BACE1), a critical enzyme in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.  We observed opposing effects of BACE1-antisense and miR-485-5p on BACE1 protein in vitro and showed that Locked Nucleic Acid-antimiR mediated knockdown of miR-485-5p as well as BACE1-antisense over-expression can prevent the miRNA-induced BACE1 suppression.  We found that the expression of BACE1-antisense as well as miR-485-5p are dysregulated in RNA samples from Alzheimer's disease subjects compared to control individuals.

By incorporating miR-126 target sequences into a GALC-expressing vector, we suppressed GALC expression in HSCs while maintaining robust expression in mature hematopoietic cells.  We used a genetic reporter strategy based on lentiviral vectors to detect microRNA activity in hematopoietic cells at single-cell resolution.  We report that miR-126 and miR-130a were expressed in HSCs and early progenitors from both mice and humans, but not in differentiated progeny. ",

Thus, mice that do not process miRNA in SMNs exhibit hallmarks of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), including sclerosis of the spinal cord ventral horns, aberrant end plate architecture, and myofiber atrophy with signs of denervation.  Here, we show that microRNA (miRNA) activity is essential for long-term survival of postmitotic spinal motor neurons (SMNs) in vivo.  We demonstrate that the heavy neurofilament subunit is a target of miR-9, a miRNA that is specifically down-regulated in a genetic model of SMA.  Furthermore, a neurofilament heavy subunit previously implicated in motor neuron degeneration is specifically up-regulated in miRNA-deficient SMNs.  These data provide evidence for miRNA function in SMN diseases and emphasize the potential role of miR-9-based regulatory mechanisms in adult neurons and neurodegenerative states.   ",

Here we also observed a loss of correlation between BACE1 mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD. Consistent with an impairment of miRNA-mediated regulation of BACE1 expression, these findings prompted us to investigate the regulatory role of the BACE1 3'-UTR element and the possible involvement of specific miRNAs in cultured neuronal (N2a) and fibroblastic (NIH 3T3) cells.  Our results may provide the molecular basis underlying BACE1 deregulation in AD and offer new perspectives on the etiology of this neurological disorder.    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulatory RNAs known to repress mRNA translation through recognition of specific binding sites located mainly in their 3'-untranslated region (UTR).  MicroRNA-298 and microRNA-328 regulate expression of mouse beta-amyloid precursor protein-converting enzyme 1.   Intriguingly, previous post-mortem analyses showed higher beta-amyloid precursor protein-converting enzyme (BACE) protein, but not mRNA, levels in the brain of patients that suffered from Alzheimer disease (AD).

Temporal lobe epilepsy induces differential expression of hippocampal miRNAs including let-7e and miR-23a/b.   let-7e was detected down-regulated expression at 0h, 1h, 6h, 2days, 7days, 50days after SE and up-regulated expression at 12h, 24h, 10days, 30days after SE, which was significantly up-regulated expression at 24h after SE (10.49 folds, P<0.01).  miR-23a/b was detected down-regulated at 0h, 1h, 6h, 12h, 2days, 7days, 10days, 30days after SE and significantly up-regulated at 24h (4.49 folds P<0.01), 50d (2.4 folds, P<0.01) after SE.

In this study, the time course of miRNA-223 expression may be related to inflammatory responses after SCI, and the time course of decreased miR-124a expression may reflect cell death.    However, miR-124a, which was present in the normal spinal cord, was not observed at the injured site.  RESULTS: Quantitative PCR revealed two peaks of miR-223 expression at 6 and 12 h and 3 days after SCI. MiR-124a expression decreased significantly from 1 day to 7 days after SCI.  In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of miR-223 around the injured site.  METHODS: We examined the expression of miRNA (miR)-223 and miR-124a in a mouse model at 6 h, 12 h, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after SCI using quantitative PCR.

AIMS: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate translational repression of target mRNAs.  MiR-29a-mediated down-regulation of NAV3 was verified by the luciferase reporter assay.  However, we found significant down-regulation of miR-29a in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains.  The database search on TargetScan, PicTar and miRBase Target identified neurone navigator 3 (NAV3), a regulator of axon guidance, as a principal target of miR-29a, and actually NAV3 mRNA levels were elevated in AD brains.  This was followed by enlargement of study population with quantitative RT-PCR analysis (n = 21).  RESULTS: By microarray analysis, we identified up-regulation of miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-338-3p in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brains, but due to a great interindividual variation, we could not validate these results by quantitative RT-PCR.  To identify miRNAs closely associated with neurodegeneration, we performed miRNA expression profiling of brain tissues of various neurodegenerative diseases.  METHODS: We initially studied the frontal cortex derived from three amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients by using a microarray of 723 human miRNAs.  Accumulating evidence indicates that various miRNAs, expressed in a spatially and temporally controlled that manner in the brain plays a key role in neuronal development.  However, at present, the pathological implication of aberrant miRNA expression in neurodegenerative events remains largely unknown.  By immunohistochemistry, NAV3 expression was most evidently enhanced in degenerating pyramidal neurones in the cerebral cortex of AD. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest the hypothesis that underexpression of miR-29a affects neurodegenerative processes by enhancing neuronal NAV3 expression in AD brains.   ",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several hundred small RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified and characterized from various organisms, including humans.  In humans, some of these miRNAs have been found to regulate (patho)physiologic conditions such as tumor progression/regression, cholesterol and glucose homeostasis, etc.  In this report, we present data on the miRNAs expressed under ischemic conditions in both the brain and blood of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo).  METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to MCAo were reperfused for either 24 or 48 hours, and both blood and brain samples were harvested.  miRNA expression profiling and oligonucleotide microarray were carried out, and the data were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and correlated with published data on protein and gene expression in MCAo rats.  RESULTS: We report here for the first time the involvement of miRNA regulation in brain pathogenesis associated with MCAo.  Comparison with the corresponding DNA microarray data revealed that the target mRNA expression is correlated with the regulation of miRNA.  We have also provided evidence that some of the miRNAs that are highly expressed in the ischemic brain can be detected in blood samples.  CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible use of miRNAs as biomarkers in stroke and related pathologies.   ",

MicroRNAS (miRNAs) have been suggested to play important roles in the central nervous system during development as well as disease.  The therapeutic potential of microRNAs in nervous system damage, degeneration, and repair.   Artificial miRNAs have also been generated for the repression of specific transcripts.  Both viral delivery and administration of modified oligonucleotides mimicking or inhibiting specific miRNAs have been effective in model systems.  Recent findings suggest that it may eventually be possible to treat some neurological disorders by restoring or inhibiting miRNAs altered by disease pathology.  Each miRNA has the ability to regulate hundreds of messenger RNA transcripts, both by causing degradation of the mRNA and by inhibition of protein translation. ",

Morphine treatment of human monocyte-derived macrophages induces differential miRNA and protein expression: impact on inflammation and oxidative stress in the central nervous system.   In order to understand the role of morphine in this process, we performed a genome-wide association study at the micro RNA (miRNA) and protein levels in human monocyte-derived macrophages (h-mdms).  Productive HIV-1 infection of microglia and perivascular macrophages and the resultant secretion of neurotoxic molecules by these cells contribute to this phenomenon.  Computational analysis predicted fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) as the strongest target gene for hsa-miR15b.  A total of 26 differentially expressed miRNA were identified (P < 0.01), of which hsa-miR-15b and hsa-miR-181b had the greatest increase and decrease in expression levels, respectively.  Both hsa-miR-15b and hsa-miR-181b have several predicted gene targets involved in inflammation and T-cell activation pathways.  Of note, we observed a decrease in FGF-2 protein expression in response to morphine.  Moreover, proteomic analysis revealed the induction of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase in response to morphine treatment.  In this context, we observed induction of MCP-2 and IL-6 by morphine.  Of note, differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-15b and 181-b) may have a potential role in regulating these processes.    Collectively, these observations demonstrate that morphine induces inflammation and oxidative stress in h-mdms thereby contributing to expansion of HIV-1 CNS reservoir expansion and disease progression.

To investigate this possibility we compared the expression of 264 human miRNAs from postmortem prefrontal cortex tissue of individuals with schizophrenia (n = 13) or schizoaffective disorder (n = 2) to tissue of 21 psychiatrically unaffected individuals using a custom miRNA microarray.  Allowing a 5% false discovery rate, we found that 16 miRNAs were differentially expressed in prefrontal cortex of patient subjects, with 15 expressed at lower levels (fold change 0.63 to 0.89) and 1 at a higher level (fold change 1.77) than in the psychiatrically unaffected comparison subjects.  The expression levels of 12 selected miRNAs were also determined by quantitative RT-PCR in our lab.  For the eight miRNAs distinguished by being expressed at lower microarray levels in schizophrenia samples versus comparison samples, seven were also expressed at lower levels with quantitative RT-PCR.  CONCLUSION: This study is the first to find altered miRNA profiles in postmortem prefrontal cortex from schizophrenia patients.    microRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

Cell culture reporter assays performed with a subset of the predicted miR-107 binding sites indicate the presence of at least one physiological miR-107 miRNA recognition sequence in the 3'-UTR of BACE1 mRNA.  Computational analysis predicted that the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) mRNA is targeted multiply by miR-107.  From the same RNA material analyzed on miRNA microarrays, mRNA expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix Exon Array microarrays on nondemented, MCI, and AD patients.  Among the AD-related miRNA expression changes, miR-107 was exceptional because miR-107 levels decreased significantly even in patients with the earliest stages of pathology.  In situ hybridization with cross-comparison to neuropathology demonstrated that particular cerebral cortical laminas involved by AD pathology exhibit diminished neuronal miR-107 expression.  We used miRNA expression microarrays on RNA extracted from human brain tissue from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center Brain Bank with near-optimal clinicopathological correlation.  Cases were separated into four groups: elderly nondemented with negligible AD-type pathology, nondemented with incipient AD pathology, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with moderate AD pathology, and AD.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that participate in posttranscriptional gene regulation in a sequence-specific manner.  However, little is understood about the role(s) of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Together, the coordinated application of miRNA profiling, Affymetrix microarrays, new bioinformatics predictions, in situ hybridization, and biochemical validation indicate that miR-107 may be involved in accelerated disease progression through regulation of BACE1.

Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) present in the serum/plasma are characteristically altered in many pathological conditions, and have been employed as diagnostic markers for specific diseases.  We examined if plasma miRNA levels are altered in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) relative to matched healthy volunteers, and explored their potential for use as diagnostic TBI biomarkers.  The plasma miRNA profiles from severe TBI patients (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score \u22648) and age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy volunteers were compared by microarray analysis.  Of the 108 miRNAs identified in healthy volunteer plasma, 52 were altered after severe TBI, including 33 with decreased and 19 with increased relative abundance.  An additional 8 miRNAs were detected only in the TBI plasma.  We used quantitative RT-PCR to determine if plasma miRNAs could identify TBI patients within the first 24\u2009h post-injury.  Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that miR-16, miR-92a, and miR-765 were good markers of severe TBI (0.89, 0.82, and 0.86 AUC values, respectively).  Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that combining these miRNAs markedly increased diagnostic accuracy (100% specificity and 100% sensitivity), compared to either healthy volunteers or orthopedic injury patients.  In mild TBI patients (GCS score >\u200912), miR-765 levels were unchanged, while the plasma levels of miR-92a and miR-16 were significantly increased within the first 24\u2009h of injury compared to healthy volunteers, and had AUC values of 0.78 and 0.82, respectively.  Plasma-derived miRNA biomarkers, used in combination with established clinical practices such as imaging, neurocognitive, and motor examinations, have the potential to improve TBI patient classification and possibly management.

        "text": "In neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain miRNA profiles are altered; thus miRNA dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease.  These small non-coding RNA regulators are highly enriched in brain where they play key roles in neuronal development, plasticity and disease.  Normal brain development and function depends on microRNA (miRNA) networks to fine tune the balance between the transcriptome and proteome of the cell.  Neuronal microRNA deregulation in response to Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta.   Bioinformatic analysis predicts that the deregulated miRNAs are likely to affect target genes present in prominent neuronal pathways known to be disrupted in AD. Remarkably, we also found that the miRNA deregulation in hippocampal cultures was paralleled in vivo by a deregulation in the hippocampus of Abeta42-depositing APP23 mice, at the onset of Abeta plaque formation.  Time-course assays of neuronal Abeta treatments show that Abeta is in fact a powerful regulator of miRNA levels as the response of certain mature miRNAs is extremely rapid.  We used sensitive TaqMan low density miRNA arrays (TLDA) on murine primary hippocampal cultures to show that about half of all miRNAs tested were down-regulated in response to Abeta peptides.  Our study dissects the complexity of human AD pathology, and addresses the hypothesis that amyloid-beta (Abeta) itself, a known causative factor of AD, causes neuronal miRNA deregulation, which could contribute to the pathomechanisms of AD.  In addition, the miRNA deregulation in hippocampal cultures and APP23 hippocampus overlaps with those obtained in human AD studies.  Taken together, our findings suggest that neuronal miRNA deregulation in response to an insult by Abeta may be an important factor contributing to the cascade of events leading to AD.   ",

Although the role of APP and PSEN genes in genetic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases is well established, fairly little is known about the molecular mechanisms affecting Abeta generation in sporadic AD. Deficiency in Abeta clearance is certainly a possibility, but increased expression of proteins like APP or BACE1/beta-secretase may also be associated with the disease.  We therefore investigated changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of sporadic AD patients and found that several miRNAs potentially involved in the regulation of APP and BACE1 expression appeared to be decreased in diseased brain.  We show here that miR-29a, -29b-1, and -9 can regulate BACE1 expression in vitro.  The miR-29a/b-1 cluster was significantly (and AD-dementia-specific) decreased in AD patients displaying abnormally high BACE1 protein.  Similar correlations between expression of this cluster and BACE1 were found during brain development and in primary neuronal cultures.  Finally, we provide evidence for a potential causal relationship between miR-29a/b-1 expression and Abeta generation in a cell culture model.  We propose that loss of specific miRNAs can contribute to increased BACE1 and Abeta levels in sporadic AD.   ",

Loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (GRN) cause ubiquitin- and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive frontotemporal dementia (FTLD-U), a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 10% of early-onset dementia patients.  Common variation in the miR-659 binding-site of GRN is a major risk factor for TDP43-positive frontotemporal dementia.   In support of these findings, the neuropathology of homozygous rs5848 T-allele carriers frequently resembled the pathological FTLD-U subtype of GRN mutation carriers.  A significant reduction in GRN protein was observed in homozygous T-allele carriers in vivo, through biochemical and immunohistochemical methods, mimicking the effect of heterozygous loss-of-function GRN mutations.  We further demonstrate that miR-659 can regulate GRN expression in vitro, with miR-659 binding more efficiently to the high risk T-allele of rs5848 resulting in augmented translational inhibition of GRN.  In a series of pathologically confirmed FTLD-U patients without GRN mutations, we show that carriers homozygous for the T-allele of rs5848 have a 3.2-fold increased risk to develop FTLD-U compared with homozygous C-allele carriers (95% CI: 1.50-6.73).  Translational regulation by miRNAs may represent a common mechanism underlying complex neurodegenerative disorders.    We suggest that the expression of GRN is regulated by miRNAs and that common genetic variability in a miRNA binding-site can significantly increase the risk for FTLD-U. ",

These cancers are thought to be linked to indirect radiation-induced bystander effect.  Radiation therapy is a primary treatment modality for brain tumors, yet it has been linked to the increased incidence of secondary, post-radiation therapy cancers.  Recent evidence suggests that bystander effect may be epigenetic in nature; however, characterization of epigenetic mechanisms involved in bystander effect generation and its long-term persistence has yet to be defined.  Bystander effect occurs when irradiated cells communicate damage to nearby, non-irradiated 'bystander' cells, ultimately contributing to genome destabilization in the non-exposed cells.  We found that localized cranial radiation exposure led to the induction of bystander effect in lead-shielded, distant spleen tissue.  To investigate the possibility that localized X-ray irradiation induces persistent bystander effects in distant tissue, we monitored the induction of epigenetic changes (i.e. alterations in DNA methylation, histone methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression) in the rat spleen tissue 24 h and 7 months after localized cranial exposure to 20 Gy of X-rays.  Further, irradiation significantly altered expression of miR-194, a miRNA putatively targeting both DNA methyltransferase-3a and MeCP2.  Specifically, this exposure caused the profound epigenetic dysregulation in the bystander spleen tissue that manifested as a significant loss of global DNA methylation, alterations in methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposable elements and down-regulation of DNA methyltransferases and methyl-binding protein methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2).  This study is the first to report conclusive evidence of the long-term persistence of bystander effects in radiation carcinogenesis target organ (spleen) upon localized distant exposure using the doses comparable with those used for clinical brain tumor treatments.

Characterization of an NF-kappaB-regulated, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of complement factor H (CFH) in metal-sulfate-stressed human brain cells.   Micro RNAs (miRNAs) represent a family of small ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that are post-transcriptional regulators of messenger RNA (mRNA) complexity.  An NF-kappaB-containing miRNA-146a-promoter-luciferase reporter construct transfected into HN cells showed significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a after aluminum-sulfate treatment that corresponded to decreased CFH gene expression.  These data suggest that (1) as in AD brain, NF-kappaB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated, modulation of CFH gene expression may contribute to inflammatory responses in aluminum-stressed HN cells, and (2) underscores the potential of nanomolar aluminum to drive genotoxic mechanisms characteristic of neurodegenerative disease processes.    This NF-kappaB-miRNA-146a-CFH signaling circuit is known to be similarly affected by Abeta42 peptides and in AD brain.

RESULTS: Wee1 protein expression was decreased in NFAs and GH-producing tumors with or without prolactin production, but no change in mRNA expression was observed with qRT-PCR.  CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that regulation of Wee1 kinase by miRs may be linked to pituitary tumorigenesis.    CONTEXT: The tumorigenic mechanisms involved in pituitary adenomas, especially of nonfunctional pituitary adenomas (NFAs), remains unclear.  Down-regulation of Wee1 kinase by a specific subset of microRNA in human sporadic pituitary adenomas.   OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the expression of Wee1 in pituitary tumors and to identify microRNAs (miRs) that can regulate its expression.  Various cell cycle inhibitors have been found to be underexpressed in pituitary tumors; however, Wee1 kinase, a nuclear protein that delays mitosis and was recently recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, has not been previously investigated in pituitary tumors.  Identification of miRs targeting the Wee1 3'-untranslated region was performed by miR array followed by expression analysis of identified miRs using qRT-PCR.  DESIGN: Expression of Wee1 was examined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).  PATIENTS: A total of 57 pituitary tissue samples including 27 NFAs, 15 GH-producing adenomas with or without prolactin overproduction, and 15 normal pituitary glands were analyzed.  Dual-luciferase assay and transient transfection of miRs into Hela cells followed by immunoblot analysis of Wee1 protein and cell proliferation analysis were carried out. ",

Joint genome-wide profiling of miRNA and mRNA expression in Alzheimer's disease cortex reveals altered miRNA regulation.   These data provided the unique opportunity to study the relationship between miRNA and mRNA expression in normal and AD brains.  In this study, we used microarrays for the first joint profiling and analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs expression in brain cortex from AD and age-matched control subjects.  Comparative analysis with independent cancer datasets showed that such miRNA-mRNA expression correlations are not static, but rather context-dependent.  Using a non-parametric analysis, we showed that the levels of many miRNAs can be either positively or negatively correlated with those of their target mRNAs.  Our results demonstrate a robust relationship between the levels of miRNAs and those of their targets in the brain.  Subsequently, we identified a large set of miRNA-mRNA associations that are changed in AD versus control, highlighting AD-specific changes in the miRNA regulatory system.  This has implications in the study of the molecular pathology of AD, as well as miRNA biology in general.   ",

Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) plays an important role in mediating memory via the control of intracellular cAMP signaling; inhibition of PDE4 enhances memory.  However, development of PDE4 inhibitors as memory enhancers has been hampered by their major side effect of emesis.  PDE4 has four subtypes (PDE4A-D) consisting of 25 splice variants.  Mice deficient in PDE4D displayed memory enhancement in radial arm maze, water maze, and object recognition tests.  These effects were mimicked by repeated treatment with rolipram in wild-type mice.  In addition, similarly as rolipram-treated wild-type mice, PDE4D-deficient mice also displayed increased hippocampal neurogenesis and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB).  Furthermore, microinfusion of lentiviral vectors that contained microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting long-form PDE4D isoforms into bilateral dentate gyri of the mouse hippocampus downregulated PDE4D4 and PDE4D5, enhanced memory, and increased hippocampal neurogenesis and pCREB.  Finally, while rolipram and PDE4D deficiency shortened \u03b12 adrenergic receptor-mediated anesthesia, a surrogate measure of emesis, miRNA-mediated PDE4D knock-down in the hippocampus did not.  The present results suggest that PDE4D, in particular long-form PDE4D, plays a critical role in the mediation of memory and hippocampal neurogenesis, which are mediated by cAMP/CREB signaling; reduced expression of PDE4D, or at least PDE4D4 and PDE4D5, in the hippocampus enhances memory but appears not to cause emesis.  These novel findings will aid in the development of PDE4 subtype- or variant-selective inhibitors for treatment of disorders involving impaired cognition, including Alzheimer's disease.   ",

High levels of high-mobility group A2 expression were more frequently observed in macroadenomas than in microadenomas (P<0.05).  Overexpression of high-mobility group A2 was observed in 39% (38/98) of pituitary adenomas compared with normal adenohypophysial tissue and was frequently found in adenomas including prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotrophic hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone and in null cell adenomas, but relatively rare in growth hormone (GH) and mixed GH/PRL adenomas.  High-mobility group A2 expression was significantly associated with tumor invasion (P<0.05) and was significantly higher in grade IV than in grades I, II, and III adenomas (P<0.05).  However, no studies have investigated the clinical significance of high-mobility group A2 and its relationship to the let-7 miRNA family in human pituitary adenomas.  Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed high-mobility group A2 expression with respect to various clinicopathologic factors in 98 pituitary adenomas.  Recent studies report that high-mobility group A2 is negatively regulated by the let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs) family in vitro.  The development of pituitary adenomas in high-mobility group A2 transgenic mice showed that high-mobility group A2 may be involved in pituitary tumorigenesis.  Overexpression of HMGA2 relates to reduction of the let-7 and its relationship to clinicopathological features in pituitary adenomas.   High-mobility group A2 is highly expressed during embryogenesis and in various benign and malignant tumors.  Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out to evaluate the expression of let-7 in 55 pituitary adenomas.  Subsequently, decreased expression of let-7 was confirmed in 23 of 55 (42%) adenomas and was correlated with high-grade tumors (P<0.05).  An inverse correlation between let-7 and high-mobility group A2 expression was evident (R=-0.33, P<0.05).  These findings support a causal link between let-7 and high-mobility group A2 whereby loss of let-7 expression induces high-mobility group A2 upregulation that represents an important mechanism in pituitary tumorigenesis and progression.

In the present study, we used a microarray platform to examine changes in the hippocampal expression levels of 444 verified rodent miRNAs at 3 and 24 hr after controlled cortical impact injury.  However, it has not yet been determined whether miRNA expression is altered after TBI.  We extended the microarray findings using quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis for a subset of the miRNAs with altered expression levels (miR-107, -130a, -223, -292-5p, -433-3p, -451, -541, and -711).

Immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of the cleaved form of caspase-6 in astrocytes in HIVE brain sections.  Exposure of cultured human primary astrocytes to HIV viral protein R (Vpr) induced p53 up-regulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-6 activation followed by cell injury.  Transgenic mice, expressing Vpr in microglial cells, demonstrated astrocyte apoptosis in brain, which was associated with caspase-6 activation and neurobehavioral abnormalities.  Overall, these data point to previously unrecognized alterations in miRNA profile in the brain during HIV infection, which contribute to cell death through dysregulation of cell death machinery.    MicroRNA profiling reveals new aspects of HIV neurodegeneration: caspase-6 regulates astrocyte survival.

However, it was not sufficient for surface protein expression, which was controlled posttranscriptionally via a separate pathway involving the ataxia telangiectasia mutated/ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related kinases.  Thus, TLR stimulation allows expression of NKG2D ligands through multiple pathways, including downmodulation of specific miRNAs.    In this paper, we clarify that LPS, which ligates TLR-4, preferentially upregulated MICA and not MICB; CL097, which ligates TLR-7/8, upregulated both MICA and MICB; and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, which ligates TLR-3, upregulated neither.  However, NKG2D ligands can also be induced on human macrophages by TLR stimulation, which has been far less studied.  This finding suggests that increased levels of MICA mRNA following LPS stimulation resulted from increased transcription.  To probe how LPS stimulation triggers MICA expression, we determined that the stability of MICA mRNA was much longer than that of MICB mRNA, but neither was changed by LPS stimulation.  Multiple mechanisms downstream of TLR-4 stimulation allow expression of NKG2D ligands to facilitate macrophage/NK cell crosstalk.   This establishes recognition of \"induced self\" as an important strategy for surveillance of infections or tumor transformation.  The activating receptor NKG2D recognizes proteins that are not normally expressed at the surface of most cells but are expressed during a cellular \"stress\" response (e.g., upon induction of the DNA damage pathway).

These results show that T\u03b2R II is a functional target of miR-106b and that miR-106b may influence TGF-\u03b2 signaling, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of AD.    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are abundantly expressed in the brain and play an important role in disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer's diseases (AD).  miR-106b aberrantly expressed in a double transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease targets TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by binding to the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs leading to their translational inhibition or sometimes degradation.  We uncovered a previously unknown alteration in temporal expression of a large set of miRNAs following a contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult rats using microarray analysis.  These altered miRNAs can be classified into 3 categories: (1) up-regulation, (2) down-regulation and (3) an early up-regulation at 4 h followed by down-regulation at 1 and 7 days post-SCI.  The bioinformatics analysis indicates that the potential targets for miRNAs altered after SCI include genes encoding components that are involved in the inflammation, oxidation, and apoptosis that are known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of SCI.

The miR-124 concentration increased in the plasma of rats 8 h after surgery to produce brain injury and peaked at 24 h, while the miR-122 and miR-133a concentrations remained at baseline values.  Furthermore, miR-122 exhibited a diagnostic sensitivity superior to that of ALT when the results were correlated to the liver histopathologic results.  Plasma MicroRNAs as sensitive and specific biomarkers of tissue injury.   BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small noncoding RNAs.  Because of their size, abundance, tissue specificity, and relative stability in plasma, miRNAs hold promise as unique accessible biomarkers to monitor tissue injury.  METHODS: We investigated the use of liver-, muscle- and brain-specific miRNAs as circulating biomarkers of tissue injury.  We used a highly sensitive quantitative PCR assay to measure specific miRNAs (miR-122, miR-133a, and miR-124) in plasma samples from rats treated with liver or muscle toxicants and from a rat surgical model of stroke.  RESULTS: We observed increases in plasma concentrations of miR-122, miR-133a, and miR-124 corresponding to injuries in liver, muscle, and brain, respectively.  miR-122 and miR-133a illustrated specificity for liver and muscle toxicity, respectively, because they were not detectable in the plasma of animals with toxicity to the other organ.  This result contrasted with the results for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase, which were both increased with either organ toxicity. ",

Generated by the ribonuclease III Dicer, microRNAs (miRNAs) are predicted to regulate up to 90% of the genes in humans, suggesting that they may control every cellular processes in all cells and tissues of the human body!  Likely to play a central role in health and disease, a dysfunctional miRNA-based regulation of gene expression may represent the main etiologic factor underlying age-related diseases affecting major organs, such as the brain.  Here, we discuss some of the limitations associated to the interpretation and applicability of miRNA data, based on our recent study on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Using transiently transfected murine neuronal N2a cells in culture, in parallel to a mouse model of AD, we were able to demonstrate a role for two miRNAs (miR-298 and miR-328) in the regulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein (APP)-converting enzyme (BACE) messenger RNA (mRNA) translation, thereby providing key insights into the molecular basis underlying BACE deregulation in AD.  However, whether miRNA data can be extrapolated and transposed to the human context of age-related diseases, such as AD, not only requires caution, but also warrants several considerations.   ",

An NF-kappaB-sensitive micro RNA-146a-mediated inflammatory circuit in Alzheimer disease and in stressed human brain cells.   Up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of CFH was observed in AD brain and in interleukin-1beta, Abeta42, and/or oxidatively stressed human neural (HN) cells in primary culture.  Here we provide evidence in AD brains of a specific up-regulation of an NF-kappaB-sensitive miRNA-146a highly complementary to the 3'-untranslated region of complement factor H (CFH), an important repressor of the inflammatory response of the brain.  Treatment of stressed HN cells with the NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrollidine dithiocarbamate or the resveratrol analog CAY10512 abrogated this response.  Transfection of HN cells using an NF-kappaB-containing pre-miRNA-146a promoter-luciferase reporter construct in stressed HN cells showed significant up-regulation of luciferase activity that paralleled decreases in CFH gene expression.  Incubation of an antisense oligonucleotide to miRNA-146a (anti-miRNA-146a; AM-146a) was found to restore CFH expression levels.  These data indicate that NF-kappaB-sensitive miRNA-146a-mediated modulation of CFH gene expression may in part regulate an inflammatory response in AD brain and in stressed HN cell models of AD and illustrate the potential for anti-miRNAs as an effective therapeutic strategy against pathogenic inflammatory signaling.

Compelling evidence links miRNAs to the control of neuronal development and differentiation, however, little is known about their role in neurodegeneration.

We determined 15 miRNAs were de-regulated during the disease processes; miR-342-3p, miR-320, let-7b, miR-328, miR-128, miR-139-5p and miR-146a were over 2.5 fold up-regulated and miR-338-3p and miR-337-3p over 2.5 fold down-regulated.  We used microarrays and RT-PCR to profile miRNA expression changes in the brains of mice infected with mouse-adapted scrapie.  De-regulation of a unique subset of miRNAs suggests a conserved, disease-specific pattern of differentially expressed miRNAs is associated with prion-induced neurodegeneration.  Only one of these miRNAs, miR-128, has previously been shown to be de-regulated in neurodegenerative disease.  Computational analysis predicted numerous potential gene targets of these miRNAs, including 119 genes previously determined to be also de-regulated in mouse scrapie.  We used a co-ordinated approach to integrate miRNA and mRNA profiling, bioinformatic predictions and biochemical validation to determine miRNA regulated processes and genes potentially involved in disease progression.  In particular, a correlation between miRNA expression and putative gene targets involved in intracellular protein-degradation pathways and signaling pathways related to cell death, synapse function and neurogenesis was identified.

Genetic ablation of Dicer in adult forebrain neurons results in abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration.   Although neuronal loss is observed in the hippocampus, cellular shrinkage is predominant in the cortex.  Here we show that the absence of Dicer in the adult forebrain is accompanied by a mixed neurodegenerative phenotype.  However, the underlying mechanisms involved in neuronal death, particularly in the adult brain, remain poorly defined.  It is now well-documented that Dicer and the fine-tuning of the miRNA gene network are important for neuronal integrity.  We further demonstrate that miRNAs belonging to the miR-15 family are potent regulators of ERK1 expression in mouse neuronal cells and co-expressed with ERK1/2 in vivo.  Finally, we show that miR-15a is specifically downregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain.  Interestingly, neuronal degeneration coincides with the hyperphosphorylation of endogenous tau at several epitopes previously associated with neurofibrillary pathology.  Transcriptome analysis of enzymes involved in tau phosphorylation identified ERK1 as one of the candidate kinases responsible for this event in vivo.  In summary, these results support the hypothesis that changes in the miRNA network may contribute to a neurodegenerative phenotype by affecting tau phosphorylation.   ",

        "text": "METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a screening of MB cell lines, the miRNA miR-199b-5p was seen to be a regulator of the Notch pathway through its targeting of the transcription factor HES1. Down-regulation of HES1 expression by miR-199b-5p negatively regulates the proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth of MB cells.  MiR-199b-5p over-expression blocks expression of several cancer stem-cell genes, impairs the engrafting potential of MB cells in the cerebellum of athymic/nude mice, and of particular interest, decreases the MB stem-cell-like (CD133+) subpopulation of cells.  In our analysis of 61 patients with MB, the expression of miR-199b-5p in the non-metastatic cases was significantly higher than in the metastatic cases (P = 0.001).  Correlation with survival for these patients with high levels of miR-199b expression showed a positive trend to better overall survival than for the low-expressing patients.  Here we have investigated medulloblastoma tumors (MBs), which arise from an early impairment of developmental processes in the cerebellum, where Notch signaling is involved in many cell-fate-determining stages.  MBs occur bimodally, with the peak incidence seen between 3-4 years and 8-9 years of age, although it can also occur in adults.  Notch regulates a subset of the MB cells that have stem-cell-like properties and can promote tumor growth.  On the basis of this evidence, we hypothesized that miRNAs targeting the Notch pathway can regulated these phenomena, and can be used in anti-cancer therapies.  BACKGROUND: Through negative regulation of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) can function in cancers as oncosuppressors, and they can show altered expression in various tumor types.  MicroRNA-199b-5p impairs cancer stem cells through negative regulation of HES1 in medulloblastoma.   To date, this is the first report that expression of a miRNA can deplete the tumor stem cells, indicating an interesting therapeutic approach for the targeting of these cells in brain tumors.    CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MB, one-third of these patients remain incurable and current treatments can significantly damage long-term survivors.  Infection with MB cells in an induced xenograft model in the mouse cerebellum and the use of an adenovirus carrying miR-199b-5p indicate a clinical benefit through this negative influence of miR-199b-5p on tumor growth and on the subset of MB stem-cell-like cells, providing further proof of concept.  We further show that in a xenograft model, MB tumor burden can be reduced, indicating the use of miR199b-5p as an adjuvant therapy after surgery, in combination with radiation and chemotherapy, for the improvement of anti-cancer MB therapies and patient quality of life.  Here we show that miR-199b-5p expression correlates with metastasis spread, identifying a new molecular marker for a poor-risk class in patients with MB.  These data showing the down-regulation of miR-199b-5p in metastatic MBs suggest a potential silencing mechanism through epigenetic or genetic alterations.  Furthermore, two cell lines (Med8a and UW228) showed significant up-regulation of miR-199b-5p upon treatment.

Inhibition of two glioblastoma-upregulated miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-23a) and exogenous overexpression of two glioblastoma-downregulated miRNAs (miR-218 and miR-219-5p) resulted in reduced soft agar colony formation but showed varying effects on cell proliferation and chemosensitivity.  Among them, glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor with dismal responses to all therapeutic modalities.  Malignant astrocytoma includes anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and glioblastoma (grade IV).  Genome-wide expression profiling identifies deregulated miRNAs in malignant astrocytoma.   The differential expression pattern of nine miRNAs was further validated by real-time RT-PCR on an independent set of malignant astrocytomas (n=72) and normal samples (n=7).  More importantly, we identified a most discriminatory 23-miRNA expression signature, by using PAM, which precisely distinguished glioblastoma from anaplastic astrocytoma with an accuracy of 95%.  We identified several differentially regulated miRNAs between these groups, which could differentiate glioma grades and normal brain as recognized by PCA.  We performed a large-scale, genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) (n=756) expression profiling of 26 glioblastoma, 13 anaplastic astrocytoma and 7 normal brain samples with an aim to find deregulated miRNA in malignant astrocytoma.

Analysis of human MBs demonstrated that 3 miR-17 approximately 92 cluster miRNAs (miR-92, miR-19a, and miR-20) were also overexpressed in human MBs with a constitutively activated Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, but not in other forms of the disease.  To test whether the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster could promote MB formation, we enforced expression of these miRNAs in GNPs isolated from cerebella of postnatal (P) day P6 Ink4c-/-; Ptch1+/- mice.  These, but not similarly engineered cells from Ink4c-/-; p53-/- mice, formed MBs in orthotopic transplants with complete penetrance.  Interestingly, orthotopic mouse tumors ectopically expressing miR-17 approximately 92 lost expression of the wild-type Ptch1 allele.  Some are thought to originate from cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) that fail to undergo normal cell cycle exit and differentiation.  Because microRNAs regulate numerous aspects of cellular physiology and development, we reasoned that alterations in miRNA expression might contribute to MB. We tested this hypothesis using 2 spontaneous mouse MB models with specific initiating mutations, Ink4c-/-; Ptch1+/- and Ink4c-/-; p53-/-.  We found that 26 miRNAs showed increased expression and 24 miRNAs showed decreased expression in proliferating mouse GNPs and MBs relative to mature mouse cerebellum, regardless of genotype.  Among the 26 overexpressed miRNAs, 9 were encoded by the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster family, a group of microRNAs implicated as oncogenes in several tumor types.  The miR-17~92 cluster collaborates with the Sonic Hedgehog pathway in medulloblastoma.   Medulloblastomas (MBs) are the most common brain tumors in children. ",

Noncoding microRNAs (miRNA) regulate gene expression by degrading messages or inhibiting translation.  Using BMC as a paradigm for the study of systemic alterations in AD, we investigated whether peripheral miRNA expression is altered in this condition.  MicroRNA levels were assessed using the microRNA microarray (MMChip) containing 462 human miRNA, and the results validated by real time PCR.  Sixteen AD patients and sixteen normal elderly controls (NEC) were matched for ethnicity, age, gender and education.  The expression of several BMC miRNAs was found to increase in AD relative to NEC levels, and may differ between AD subjects bearing one or two APOE4 alleles.  As compared to NEC, miRNAs significantly upregulated in AD subjects and confirmed by qPCR were miR-34a and 181b.  Predicted target genes downregulated in Alzheimer BMC that correlated with the upregulated miRNAs were largely represented in the functional categories of Transcription/Translation and Synaptic Activity.

Here, we studied the function of miR-133b during zebrafish spinal cord regeneration and show upregulation of miR-133b expression in regenerating neurons of the brainstem after transection of the spinal cord.  miR-133b has been shown to promote tissue regeneration in other tissue, but its ability to do so in the nervous system has yet to be tested.  Inhibition of miR-133b expression by antisense morpholino (MO) application resulted in impaired locomotor recovery and reduced regeneration of axons from neurons in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, superior reticular formation and intermediate reticular formation.  miR-133b targets the small GTPase RhoA, which is an inhibitor of axonal growth, as well as other neurite outgrowth-related molecules.  Our results indicate that miR-133b is an important determinant in spinal cord regeneration of adult zebrafish through reduction in RhoA protein levels by direct interaction with its mRNA.  While RhoA has been studied as a therapeutic target in spinal cord injury, this is the first demonstration of endogenous regulation of RhoA by a microRNA that is required for spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish.  The ability of miR-133b to suppress molecules that inhibit axon regrowth may underlie the capacity for adult zebrafish to recover locomotor function after spinal cord injury.   ",

In this analysis, the number of dysregulated miRNAs fell from 28 to 9 miRNAs.  While most miRNAs levels showed little variation across all samples suggesting that autism does not induce global dysfunction of miRNA expression, some miRNAs among the autistic samples were expressed at significantly different levels compared to the mean control value.  Twenty-eight miRNAs were expressed at significantly different levels compared to the non-autism control set in at least one of the autism samples.

IFN-beta treatment reduced miR-21 expression in glioma cells markedly, and IFN-beta administration suppressed the growth of glioma-initiating cell-derived intracranial tumors.  Thus, the results of our study show that the downregulation of miR-21 contributes to the antitumor effects of IFN-beta and that miR-21 expression is negatively regulated by STAT3 activation.  These results highlight the importance of understanding the transcriptional regulation of the miRNAs involved in oncogenesis.   ",

Specific microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that support homeostatic gene expression, are significantly altered in abundance in human neurological disorders.  In monocytes, increased expression of an NF-\u03baB-regulated miRNA-146a down-regulates expression of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), an essential component of Toll-like/IL-1 receptor signaling.  Here we extend those observations to the hippocampus and neocortex of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain and to stressed human astroglial (HAG) cells in primary culture.  In 66 control and AD samples we note a significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of IRAK-1 and a compensatory up-regulation of IRAK-2.  Using miRNA-146a-, IRAK-1-, or IRAK-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, we observe decreases in IRAK-1 and increases in miRNA-146a and IRAK-2 expression in interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and amyloid-\u03b2-42 (A\u03b242) peptide-stressed HAG cells.  NF-\u03baB-mediated transcriptional control of human IRAK-2 was localized to between -119 and +12 bp of the immediate IRAK-2 promoter.  The NF-\u03baB inhibitors curcumin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or CAY10512 abrogated both IRAK-2 and miRNA-146a expression, whereas IRAK-1 was up-regulated.  Incubation of a protected antisense miRNA-146a was found to inhibit miRNA-146a and restore IRAK-1, whereas IRAK-2 remained unaffected.  These data suggest a significantly independent regulation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 in AD and in IL-1\u03b2+A\u03b242 peptide-stressed HAG cells and that an inducible, NF-\u03baB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of IRAK-1 coupled to an NF-\u03baB-induced up-regulation of IRAK-2 expression drives an extensively sustained inflammatory response.  The combinatorial use of NF-\u03baB inhibitors with miRNA-146a or antisense miRNA-146a may have potential as a bi-pronged therapeutic strategy directed against IRAK-2-driven pathogenic signaling.    The interactive signaling of NF-\u03baB and miRNA-146a further illustrate interplay between inducible transcription factors and pro-inflammatory miRNAs that regulate brain IRAK expression. ",

During a research for miRNAs that are differentially expressed in cerebral cortex of APPswe/PSDeltaE9 mice (a model for Alzheimer's disease) and age-matched controls, one candidate miRNA that is relatively highly expressed, miR-34a, was studied further because sequence analysis suggested a likely interaction with the 3'-untranslated region of bcl2 mRNA.  However, little is understood about the roles of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease.  No effect on bcl2 mRNA level was observed.  We show that the expression of miR-34a is inversely correlated with the protein level of bcl2 in APPswe/PSDeltaE9 mice and age-matched controls, and miR-34a expression directly inhibits bcl2 translation in SH-SY5Y cells.  Consistently, miR-34a knockdown through antisense LNA oligonucleotides increased the level of bcl2 protein in SH-SY5Y cells, which was accompanied by a decrease of active caspase-3.  Western blot analysis of active caspase-3 showed higher levels in APPswe/PSDeltaE9 mice and stable transfecant cell line of miR-34a than in controls.  These findings suggested that bcl2 is an important functional target for miR-34a, and the abnormal expression of miR-34a may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, at least in part by affecting the expression of bcl2.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor samples were obtained during transphenoidal surgery from patients with Cushing disease and normal pituitary tissues from autopsies.  CONCLUSION: Our results support the possibility that altered miRNA expression profile might be involved in corticotrophic tumorigenesis.  RESULTS: We found underexpression of miR-145 (2.0-fold; P = 0.04), miR-21 (2.4-fold; P = 0.004), miR-141 (2.6-fold; P = 0.02), let-7a (3.3-fold; P = 0.003), miR-150 (3.8-fold; P = 0.04), miR-15a (4.5-fold; P = 0.03), miR-16 (5.0-fold; P = 0.004), and miR-143 (6.4-fold; P = 0.004) in ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors when compared to normal pituitary tissues.  There were no differences between miRNA expression and tumor size as well as miRNA expression and ratio of remission after surgery, except in patients presenting lower miR-141 expression who showed a better chance of remission.  MicroRNAs differentially expressed in ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors.   More than 50% of miRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites of the genome.  CONTEXT: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, functioning as antisense regulators of gene expression by targeting mRNA and contributing to cancer development and progression.  However, the lack of knowledge about miRNA target genes postpones full understanding of the biological functions of down-regulated or up-regulated miRNAs in corticotropinomas.   ",

Here we show that LRRK2 interacts with the microRNA (miRNA) pathway to regulate protein synthesis.  Drosophila e2f1 and dp messenger RNAs are translationally repressed by let-7 and miR-184*, respectively.

Genetic deletion of let-7, antagomir-mediated blockage of let-7 and miR-184* action, transgenic expression of dp target protector, or replacement of endogenous dp with a dp transgene non-responsive to let-7 each had toxic effects similar to those of pathogenic LRRK2.

        "text": "The PTEN-regulating microRNA miR-26a is amplified in high-grade glioma and facilitates gliomagenesis in vivo.   Activated oncogenic signaling is central to the development of nearly all forms of cancer, including the most common class of primary brain tumor, glioma.  Research over the last two decades has revealed the particular importance of the Akt pathway, and its molecular antagonist PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), in the process of gliomagenesis.  Recent studies have also demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) may be responsible for the modulation of cancer-implicated genes in tumors.  Here we report the identification miR-26a as a direct regulator of PTEN expression.  We also show that miR-26a is frequently amplified at the DNA level in human glioma, most often in association with monoallelic PTEN loss.  Finally, we demonstrate that miR-26a-mediated PTEN repression in a murine glioma model both enhances de novo tumor formation and precludes loss of heterozygosity and the PTEN locus.  Our results document a new epigenetic mechanism for PTEN regulation in glioma and further highlight dysregulation of Akt signaling as crucial to the development of these tumors.   ",
